This is a simple timer made in python but instead of playing a sound like most timers do this one will display a pop-up on the screen
To use it open your terminal and run the these commands:
`git clone https://github.com/fire9dragon/python-timer`
`cd python-timer`
`pip3 install -r req.txt`
`python3 timer.py`

NOTE: the thired command only needs to be run on linux if you are on windows you can ignore the "pip3 install -r req.txt"
